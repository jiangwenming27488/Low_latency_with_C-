Here are some defined constrant limits: 

	1) "LOG_QUEUE_SIZE" represents the size of the lock-free queue used by the logger. THis holds the maximum number of characters that can be held in memory without the logger queue being full. 

	2) "ME_MAX_TICKERS" represents the number of trading instruments the exchange supports. 

	3) "ME_MAX_CLIENT_UPDATES" holds the maximum number of unprocessed order requests from all clients that the matching engine has not processed yet. This also represents the maximum numbre of order responses from the matching engine that the order server has not published yet. 

	4) "ME_MAX_MARKET_UPDATES" represents the maximum number of market updates generated by the matching engine that have not yet been published by the market data publisher. 

	5) "ME_MAX_NUM_CLIENTS" holds how many maximum simultaneous market participants can exit in our trading ecosytem. 

	6) "ME_MAX_ORDER_IDS" is the maximum number of orders possible for a single trading instrument, 

	7) "ME_MAX_PRICE_LEVELS" represents the maximum depth of price levels for the limit order book that the matching engine maintans. 

Note that these values have been chosen arbitrarily here; these can be increased or decreased, depending on the capacity of the system on which we run the electronic trading ecosystem. 
We choose powers of two to enable the possibility of using shifts over multiplies when trying to compute addresses.
