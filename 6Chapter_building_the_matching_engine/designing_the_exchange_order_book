The limit order book is organized as a collection of by orders (referred to as bids) and sell orders (referred to as asks). 
Orders that are entered at the same price are organized in the First in First Out (FIFO) order in our matching engine. 

For the order book we build inside the matching engine, we have a list of bid prices and ask prices that have active orders. 
Each price level is represented by the "MEOrderAtPrice" struct. 
The bids are sorted from highest to lowest price level, and the ask are sorted from lowest to highest price level. 
Each "MEOrdersAtPrice" stores the individual ordrs from highest to lowest priority in a doubly linked list. 
Information for each individual order is contained in the "MEOrder" strucs. 
We will track each price level in a has map type "OrdersAtPriceHashMap", which is indexed by the price of the level. 
We will also track each "MEOrder" object by their "market_order_id_" value in a hash map of type "OrderHashMap".
