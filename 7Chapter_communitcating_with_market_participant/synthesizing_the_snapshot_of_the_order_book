The process of synthesizing the snapshot of the order books for the different trading instruments is like building "OrderBook". 
However, the difference here is that the snapshot synthesis process only needs to maintain the last state of the live orders, so it is a simpler container. 
The "addToSnapshot()" method we will build next receives an "MDPMarketUPdate" message every time there is a new incremental market data update provided to "SnapshotSynthesizer".
