We will start building the order gateway server infrastructure, which is responsible for setting up a TCP server for clients to connect to. 
THe order gateway server also needs to process incoming client request from different clients in the order in which they arrive and forward those to the matching engine. 
Finally, it also needs to receive the order responses from the matching engine and forward them to the corrent TCP connection for the corresponding market participant. 

To refresh you memory, the order gateway server receives new TCP connections or client requests on established TCP connections. 
Then, thos requests go through a FIFO sequencer stage to make sure that requests are processed in the exact order in which they arrived at the exchange's infrastructure. 
There is a transformation between the internal matching engine format and the public order data format.
