Remember that "SnapshotSynthesizer" runs on its own thread separate from the "MarketDataPublisher thread to not cause latencies on the component that publishes the incremental market data stream. 
The "run()" method is the method assigned to the "SnpashotSynthesizer" thread. 
THe only task it performs is checking the "snpashot_md_updates_" lock-free queue for new entries, which the "MarketDataPublisher" sends incremental "MDPMarketUpdate" messages on. 
For each incremental "MDPMarketUpdate" message it reads, it calls the "addToSnapshot()" method we built earlier. 
Additionally, it checks the "last_snapshot_time_" variable against the current time obtained from "getCurrentTime()" to see whether a minute has elaspsed. 
If at least a minute has elapsed since the last time a snapshot was published, it calls the "publishSnapshot()" mehtod to publish a new snapshot. 
It also remembers the current time as the last time a full snapshot was published.
