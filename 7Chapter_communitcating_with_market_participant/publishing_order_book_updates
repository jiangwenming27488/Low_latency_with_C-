The main "run()" loop in "MarketDataPublisher" does a couple of important things
First, it drains the "outgoing_md_updates_" queue by reading any new "MEMarketDataUpdats" published by the matching engine. 

Once it has a "MEMarketUpdate" message from the matching engine, it will proceed to write it ot the "incrememntal_socket_" UDP socket. 
But it needs to write out the message in the "MDPMarketUpdate" format, which is just a sequence number folled by a "MEMarketUpdate" message. 
As we saw in the "OrderServer", it will achieve this here by first writing "next_inc_seq_num_", which is the next incremental sequence number to be sent out on the incremental stream, and then write "MEMarketupdate", which it received fromthe matching engine.


It needs to do one additional step, which is to write the same incremental update it wrote to the socket to the "snapshot_md_updates_""LQueue" ot inform the "SnapshotSynthesisizer" component about the new incremental update from the matching engine that was sent to the clients

Finally, it incrememnts the incremental stream sequence number tracker for the next message that wil be sent out and calls "sendAndRecv()" on "incremental_socket_" sp that the messages get put on the wire.
