The "SnapshotSynthesizer" constructor takes an argument of the "MDPMarketUpdateLFQueue" type passed to it from the "MarketDataPublisher" component. 
It also receives the network interface name and the snapshot IP and port to represent the multicast stream. 
The consturctor initializes the "snapshot_me_updates_" data member from the argument passed to it and initializes "logger_" with a new filename. 
It initializes "MeMarketUpdata" "MemPool" to be of the size "ME_MAX_ORDER_IDS". 
It also initializes "snapshot_socket_" and configures it to publish messages on the snapshot multicast IP and port on the provided network interface. 

We also add a "start()" method here in the same way as we did with our other classes before. 
THis "start()" method sets the "run_" flag to true, creates and launches a thread, and assigns the "run()" method to the thread. 


The destructor for this class is extremely simple; it just calls the "stop()" method. 
The "stop()" method is also extremely simple and just sets the "run_" flag to false so that the "run()" method exits.
