First define a few important concepts and terms when it comes to low latency streaming applications. 
Let get started with a few basics and build up from there into more complex concepts. 

	1) Latency in video streaming/ glass to glass: Video streaming is defined as audio-video content delivered in real time or near real time. 
Latency is general refers to the time delay between an input event and the output event. 
in the context of live video streaming applications, latency refers specifically to the time from when a live video stream hits the camera on the recording device and then get transported to the target audience's screens and get rendered and displayed there. 

	2) Video distribution services and context delivery networks: video distribution service (VDS) is a fancy term for a relatively easy-to-understand concept. 
A VDS basically means the system responsible for taking multipleincoming streams of video and audio from the sources and presenting thems to the viewers. CDN is a means of efficiently distributing context across the globe. 

	3) Transcoding, transmuxing, and transrating: 
		a) Transcoding refers to the process of decoding a media stream from one format (so lower-level details such as codec, video size, sampling rates, encoder formats, etc.) and possibly recoding it in a different format or with different parameters. 

		b) Transmuzing is similar to transcoding but here, the delivery format changes without any changes to the encoding, as in the case of transcoding. 

		c) Transrating is also similar to transcoding, but we change the video bitrate; usually, it is compressed to a lower value. 
The video bitrate is the number of bits (or kilobits) being transferred per second and captures the information and quality in the video stream.
