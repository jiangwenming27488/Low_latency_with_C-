RTSP is an application layer protocol that was used for the low latency streaming of videos. 
It also has playback capabilites to allow playing and pausing the video content and can handle mutliple data streams. 
RTSP was replaced by modern protocls such as HLS and DASH because a lot of receivers did not support RTSP; it was incompatble with HTTP and lost popluarity
