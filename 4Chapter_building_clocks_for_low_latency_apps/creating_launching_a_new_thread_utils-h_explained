The method defined for "thread_util.h" creates a new thread object, sets the thread affinity on the thread, and forwards the function and related arguments that the thread will run during its execution. 
This is achieved in the "thread_body" lambda, which is passed to the constructor of "std::thread". 
Note the use of variadic template arguments and perfect forwarding to allow this method to be used, running all kinds of functions, arbitrary types, and any number of arguments. 
After creating the thread, the method waits till the thread either starts running successfully or fails because if failed to set thread affinity, which is what the call to "t->join()" does.
