We have had several discussions on dynamic memory allocation, the steps the OS needs to perform, and why dynamic memory allocation is slow. 
Dynamic memory allocation os so slow in fact that low latency applications actively try to avoid it as  much as possible on the critical path. 
We cannot build useful applications without creating and deleting many objects at runtime, and dynamic memory allocation is too slow for low latency applications.
