The code to add new elements to the queue is implemented in two parts: 
	1) "getNextToWriteTo()", returns a pointer to the next element to write new data to. 

	2) "updateWriteIndex()", increments the write index, "next_write_index_", once the element has been written to the slot provided. 

We designed it insuch a way that, instead of having a single "write()" function, we provide the user with a pointer to the element and if the objects are quite large then not all of it needs to be updateded or overwritten. 
Additionally, this design makes it much easier to deal with race conditions.
