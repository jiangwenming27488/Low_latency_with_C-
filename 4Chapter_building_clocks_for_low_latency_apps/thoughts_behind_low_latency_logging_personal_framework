Logging is an important part of any application, whether it is logging general application behavoir, warnings, errors, or even performance statistics. 
However, a lot of important logging output is actually from performance-critical components that are on a critical path. 

A naive logging approach would be to output to the screen, while a slightly better approach would be for logs to be saved to one or more log files. 
However, a few problems come up.
Disk I/O is extramely slow and unpredictable, and string operations and fromatting themselves are slow. 
For these reasons, performing these operations on performance-critical thread is a terrible idea, so we will build a solution to alleviate the downsides while preserving the ability to output logs as needed.
