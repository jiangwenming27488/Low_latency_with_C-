When the exact number of objects of a certain type that will be required is known ahead of time, you can decide to create exactly that number when needed. 
In practice, there are many cases where the exact number of objects is not known ahead of time. 
This means we need to create objects on the fly using dynamic memory allocation. 

The solution we will use is to pre-allocate large blocks of memory at startup and serve out required amounts at runtime -- that is, do the memory allocation and deallocation steps ourselves from this storage pool. 
This ends up performing significantly better for a lot of different reasons, such as beig able to limit the memory poool usage to certain components in our system instead of all processes running on the server. 
We can also control the memory storage and allocation and deallocation algorithms, tuning them to perform optimally for our specific app.
