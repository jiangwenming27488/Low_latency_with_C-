We needto define another structure that will represent the total quantity avaialable at the best bid and ask price. 
This will represent the best buy and sell prices available in the market as well as the sum of the quantities of all the orders at these prices. 
This structure, called BBO, has four members

	1) "bid_price_"

	2) "ask_price_" (both "Price" types to represent the best prices)

	3) "bid_qty_"

	4) "ask_qty_" 

The BBO abstration is used by many different components inside the trade engine. 
Typically, this is used by components that need a summary of the best market prices and liquidity, instead of the full depth of the book and all the details about each order in the book.
A component such as the "RiskManager" componenet, which only needs to compute the open Profit and Loss (PnL) for an open position when the top-of-book prices change, does not need access to the full order book and instead can be simplified using a BBO abstration. 
Other components, such as "FeatureEngine", "PosistionKeeper", "LiquidityTaker", and "MarketMaker", also use the BBO abstration where the full order book is not needed.
