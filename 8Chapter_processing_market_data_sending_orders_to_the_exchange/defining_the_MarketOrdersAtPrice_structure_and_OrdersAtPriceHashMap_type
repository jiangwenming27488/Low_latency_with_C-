The "MarketOrdersAtPrice" struct is identical to the "MEOrdersAtPrice" struct we built for the matching "MEOrderBook" engine. 
It contains "Side", "Price", and a "MarketOrder" "first_mkt_order_" pointer to represent the beginning of the "MarketOrder"-linked list at this price. 
It also contains two "MarketOrdersAtPrice" pointers, "prev_entry_" and "next_entry_", since we will create a doubly linked list of "MarketOrdersAtPrice" objects to represent the price levels.

The constructors for this class are self-explanatory. 
It simply initializes the data members with the arguments provided. 

The "toString()" method is identical to the one in the matching engine. 

Finally, "OrdersAtPriceHashMap" is identical to the one we built for the matching engine. 
It represents a hash map from "Price" to "MarketOrdersAtPrice" pointers.
