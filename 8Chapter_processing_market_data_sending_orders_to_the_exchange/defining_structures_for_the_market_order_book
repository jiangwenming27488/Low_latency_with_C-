First, the same Data structure as "MEOrderBook" and "MarketOrderBook" have identical design. 
Each order is represented in a "MarketOrder" struct, which is a subset of the "MEOrder" struct we built for the matching engine. 
We will also have an "OrderHashMap" type, as we did in the matching engine, which will be a hash map from "OrderId" to these "MarketOrder" objects. 
Orders at the same price are held in a "MarketOrdersAtPrice" struct as we did in the matching engine, which will be a doubly linked list of "MarketOrder" objects. 
Remember that we need this structure to maintain all the orders with the same price and side attribute and arrange them in FIFO order. 
We will also build an "OrdersAtPriceHashMap" map, as we did in the matching engine to be a hash map from "Price" to these "MarketOrdersAtPrice" objects.
