As mentioned before, low latency and throughput are related but not identical. 
For that reason, sometimes some applications that need the highest throughput possible might have some differences in design and implemenntation to maximize throughput. 
The point is that maximumizing throguhput might come as the cost of sacrificing average performance latencies or increasing peak latencies to achieve that.
