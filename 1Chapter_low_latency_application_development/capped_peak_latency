We use the term capped peak latency to refer to the requirement that there needs to be a well-defined upper threshold for the maximum possible latency the application can every encounter. 
This behavior is important for all latency-sensitive applications, but most important for latency-critical applications. 
But even in the general case, applications that have extremely high-performance latency for a handful of cases will typically destory the performance of the system. 
WHat this really means is that the application needs to handle any input, scenario, or sequence of events and do so within a low latency period. 
Of course, the performance to handle a very rare and specific scenario can possibly be much higher than the most likely case, but the point here is that it cannto be unbounded or unacceptable.
