What this really means is that such applications will make sure that the expected performance latency for all kinds of different inputs or events has as little variance as possible. 
It is impossible to achieve zero latency variance, but some choices can be made in data structures, alogrithms, code implementation, and setup to try to minimize this as much as possible.
