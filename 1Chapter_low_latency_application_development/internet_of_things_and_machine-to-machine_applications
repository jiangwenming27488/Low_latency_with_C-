Internet of things (IoT) and machine-to-machine (M2M) applications are based on connecting devices to collect, store and exchange data with each other automatically. 
Overall, while IoT and M2M are simialer in nature, there are some differences around aspects such as automatically. 
Overall, while IoT and M2M are similar in nature, there are some differences around aspects such as networks, scalability, interoperablitly, and human interactions. 

IoT is a broad term that refers to connectiong different physical devices togeather. 
IoT devices are generally actuators and sensors that are embedded inside other larger devices such as smart thermostats, refrigerators, doorbells, cars, smart watches, TVs, and medical devices. 
These devices operate on platforms with limited computing resources, power requirements, and minimal available memory resources. 

M2M is a communication method where multiple machines interact with each other usig wried or wireless connections without any human oversight or interaction. 
The point here is that internet connectivity is not necessary for M2M. 
So IoT is a subset of M2M, but M2m is a broad universe of M2M communication-based systems. 
M2M technology is used in deffernet applications such as security, tracking and tracing, automation, manufacturing, and facility managment.
