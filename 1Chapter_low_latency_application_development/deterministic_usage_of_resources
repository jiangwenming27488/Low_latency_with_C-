It is critical for low latency applications to use resources very efficiently. 
Embedded applications are especially limited in time and memory resources. 
In langs like java and Python that rely on automatic garbage collection, there is an element of non-determinism that is, the garbage collector can introduce large latenies in performance unpredictably. 
Additionally, for systems that are very limited in memory, low level languages such as C/C++ can do special thing such as placing data at custom sections or addreses in memory through pointer. 
In langs such as C/C++, the programmer is in charge of explicit creation, management, and deallocation of memory resources, allowing for deterministic and efficient use of resources.
