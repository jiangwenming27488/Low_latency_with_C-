An example of C++ optimization technique that levarages storage choice optimization is Small String Optimization (SSO). 
SSO attempts to use local storage for short strings if they are smaller than a certain size (32 chars) instead of the default of dynamically allocated memory for string content storage. 

In summary, you should think carefully about where the data gets stored during the execution of your program, especially in the critical sections. 
We should try to use registers and local variables as much as possible an doptimize cache performance. 
Use volatile, static, global, and dynamic memory only when necessary or when it does not affect performance on the critical path.
