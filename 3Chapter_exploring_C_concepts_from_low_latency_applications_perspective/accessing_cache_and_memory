We have frequently referrred to cache performance while discussing different uses of C++ features since accessing the main memory is significantly slower than the clock cycles used to execute CPU instructions or access registers or cache storage. 
Here are som general points to keep in mind when trying to optimize cache and memory access: 

	1) aligning data

	2) accessing data

	3) Using large data structures 

	4) Grouping Variables together 

	5) Grouping functions together
