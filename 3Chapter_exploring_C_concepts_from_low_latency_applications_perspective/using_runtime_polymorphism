Runtime polymorphism is a elegant solution when the member function that needs to be called will be determined at runtime instead of compile time. 
"Virtual" functions are the key to implementing runtime polymorphism, but they have an additional overhead compared to non-veritual functions calls. 

Inheritance in C++ is another important OOP concept but be careful when the inheritance structure gets too complicated since there are many subtle inefficiencies that can be introduced. 
Chile classes inherit everysingle data member from their parent class, so the size of the child classes can become quite large and lead to poor chache performance.
