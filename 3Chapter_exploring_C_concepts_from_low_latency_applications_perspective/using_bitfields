Bitfields are jst structs where the developer controls the number of bits assigned to each member. 
This makes the data as compact as possibe and greatly improves cache performance for many objects. 
Bitfield memebers are also usually modified using bitmask operations, which are very efficient, as we have seen before. 
Accessing the members of bitfields is less efficient than accessing the members of a ragular structure, so it is important to carefully assess whether using bitfields and improving the cache performance is worthwhile.
