The trading engine is the brain of a market participant's trading system. 
This is where intelligence resides, and where the trading decisions are made. 
This component is responsible for consuming the normalized market data updates from the market data consumer component. 
It will usually also build the complete limit order book to reflect the state of the market or, at the very least, a simplified variant of the order book, depending on the requirements of the trading strategies. 
It usually also builds analytics on top of the liquidity and prices from the order book and makes automated trading decisions. 
This component uses the order gateway client component to communicate with the trading exchange.
