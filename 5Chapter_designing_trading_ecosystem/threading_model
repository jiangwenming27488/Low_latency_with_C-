In the system, the matching engine, the market data publisher, and the order gateway server will be independent threads. 
This intentional so that each one of these components can operate independently, and during periods of bursts in market activity, the entire system can achieve maximum throughput. 
Also, there are other tasks that each component needs to perform -- for example, the order gateway server must maintain connectivity with all market participants, even when the matching engine is busy. 
Similarly, lets us assume the market data publisher is busy sending out market data on the network; we do not want the matching engine or the order gateway server to slow down.
