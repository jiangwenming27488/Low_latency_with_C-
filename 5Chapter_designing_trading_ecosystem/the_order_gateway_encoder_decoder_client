The order gateway client component is the complement of the exchange order gateway server on the market participants' side. 
The responsibility of this component is to establish and maintain TCP connections with the exchange's order gateway infrastructure. 
It is also responsible for encoding strategy order requests in the correct exchange order messaging protocol and decoding exchange responses into an internal format that the trading engine uses.
