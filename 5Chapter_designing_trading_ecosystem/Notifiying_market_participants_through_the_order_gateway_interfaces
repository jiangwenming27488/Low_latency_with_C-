The point here is thatthis public market data that is available to everyone that has access to and subscribed to the market data stream. 
Below I'm going to list the other interface that theexchange uses to communicate with market participants about updates for their orders - the order gateway interfaces. 
There are a few key differences between the information provided by the public market data feed and the information provided by the order gateway infrastructure: 

	1) Understanding the difference in network protocols: market data publisher uses the UDP protocol at the netwrk level, and the order gateway infrastructure uses the TCP protocol at the network level in their connections with market participants. 

	2) Differtiating between public and private information: The market data publisher publishes public information while hiding some sensitive information, such as which client and order belongs to or which clients participated in a matching transaction. The order gateway server, on the other hand, only publishes order update notifications to the clients who own the orders that are being updated. 

	3) Sending order requests for participants' orders: Another major difference that should be obvious by now is that the order gateway component sending facilitates a bi-directional communication channel.
