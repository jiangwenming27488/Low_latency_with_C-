Sophisticated trading strategies need to build additional intelligence over just the order book. 
These trading strategies need to implement various trading signals and intelligence on top of the prices, liquidity, trade transactions, and order book published by the exchange. 
THe idea here is to build intelligence, which can be a combination of technical analysis style indicators, staticstical predictive signals and models, and market mircostructure-related statistical edges.
There are many different terms used in practice for such predictive edges - trading signals, indicators, features, and so on. 
The component inside the trading system that constructs and wires together a collection of such predictive signals is trading strategties, but to reiterate here that feature engines can get quite sophisticated and complicated depending on the strategy's complexity.
